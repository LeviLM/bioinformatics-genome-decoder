=== TASK 3: CODON LENGTH INFERENCE ===

RNA length: 204
Protein length: 177
RNA alphabet size: 4
Protein alphabet size: 20
Theoretical minimum codon length (k): 3

No fixed-length codon size and reading frame were found that allow the RNA sequence to translate directly into the given protein sequence.

Conclusion: 
The codon length must be at least 3 based on the RNA and protein alphabet sizes. However, the provided RNA and protein sequences do not correspond via a simple contiguous fixed length translation.
