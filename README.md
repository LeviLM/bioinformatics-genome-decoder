# Bioinformatics Genome Decoder

## Overview
This project is a Python-based bioinformatics analysis pipeline designed to process and analyse genomic sequence data. It performs core biological transformations and analytical tasks commonly used in computational biology, producing structured outputs suitable for reporting and further analysis.

The program was developed as part of a university computational bioinformatics module.

## Features
- DNA to RNA transcription
- RNA to protein translation
- k-mer frequency analysis
- GC content calculation
- Open Reading Frame (ORF) detection
- Structured text-based output for reporting

## Project Structure
- `src/` – Python source code
- `data/` – Input genomic sequence files
- `results/` – Generated analysis outputs
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Standard Python libraries for file handling and string processing

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Processing and analysing biological sequence data programmatically
- Implementing biologically accurate transcription and translation rules
- Designing reproducible analysis pipelines
- Generating interpretable outputs for scientific reporting

## Notes
This project was completed as part of assessed university coursework. The implementation and documentation reflect my own work and understanding of computational bioinformatics principles.
